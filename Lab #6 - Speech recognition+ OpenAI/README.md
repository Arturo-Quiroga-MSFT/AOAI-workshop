This repository contains Python code examples that demonstrate how to use the Azure Cognitive Services Speech SDK for both text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) tasks, and  OpenAI's API

## Features

- **Text to Speech**: Convert written text into natural sounding speech.
- **Azure OpenAI**  : Embedding model.
